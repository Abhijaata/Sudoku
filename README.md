Sudoku Solver
=============

This project is an implementation of a **Sudoku Solver** using Python. It takes a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle as input and returns the solved puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.

Features
--------

*   Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
*   Fast and efficient backtracking algorithm.
*   Simple and easy-to-understand Python code.
*   Command-line interface for ease of use.

Installation
------------

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    git clone https://github.com/Abhijaata/Sudoku.git
    
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    
    `cd Sudoku` 
    
3.  **Install dependencies (if any):** This project does not require any external Python libraries, but make sure you have Python installed. You can check the Python version using:

    
    `python --version` 
    

Usage
-----

1.  **Run the Sudoku Solver:**
    
    You can run the solver directly from the command line. For example:

    
    `python sudoku_solver.py` 
    
2.  **Input Sudoku Puzzle:**
    
    The program expects a 9x9 grid with empty spaces represented by `0`. You can either input the puzzle directly in the code or modify the script to accept inputs from a file.
    

Algorithm
---------

The algorithm uses **backtracking** to fill in the Sudoku grid:

1.  Traverse the grid cell by cell.
2.  If an empty cell is found, try placing digits from 1 to 9.
3.  Check if the number violates any Sudoku rules (row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid).
4.  If it doesnâ€™t, move to the next cell.
5.  If placing any number violates the Sudoku rules, backtrack and try a different number.
6.  Continue until the puzzle is solved.
